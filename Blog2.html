      <h1> Blog by The Spatial Distillery Co. </h1>
      <h2> The uses of GIS</h2>
      <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS (geographic information systems) are software technologies that assist in the 
        storage, retrieval, analysis, and distribution of geographic data. This can include everything 
        from satellite imagery to demographic databases to topographical maps. GIS is an enormously powerful 
        tool for organizations that deal with high-volume spatial data, like real estate developers, insurance 
        companies, telecommunication companies or government. GIS is helping map out the future of how we 
        understand our world by better understanding the relationship between people, places, and things.</p>
      <h5 class="mainpadding1">Where is GIS used?</h5>
      <p class="gridtextgrey"> GIS can be used for many purposes. It can be used for tracking population, 
        economic development, and natural hazards. GIS can also be used for retail site selection, insurance 
        mapping and telecommunications. GIS and digital mapping are used daily as part of web mapping apps, 
        finding your favorite store, or locating where your friends are in your favorite social media app.</p>
	  <h5 class="mainpadding1">1. Mapping Visualization</h5>
    <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS can be used to provide a visual interpretation of data. Google Maps is an excellent example of a web-based GIS mapping solution. </p>
    <h5 class="mainpadding1">2. Telecom and Network Management</h5>
    <p class="gridtextgrey">Telecom companies use GIS to better plan, design and manage their Telecom networks. 5G rollouts rely heavily on the use of GIS to maximise the coverage and pinpoint where networks are needed. </p>
    <h5 class="mainpadding1">3. Policing and Emergency Services</h5>
    <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS helps to model and analyze crime data and better plan deployment of resources. </p>
    <h5 class="mainpadding1">4. Urban planning / Government</h5>
    <p class="gridtextgrey">Governments use GIS for urban growth planning and allocation of resources. 
      GIS is used across all levels of government in health, emergencies, urban planning, and smart cities. </p>
    <h5 class="mainpadding1">5. Transportation Planning</h5>
    <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS data is commonly used for managing transportation. With the addition of 
      environmental and real time data in a GIS platform routes can be optimized and last mile deliveries 
      streamlined.</p>

      <h1>What are some of the industries that use GIS?</h1>
      <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS is used by a wide range of industries. It can be found in organizations such as the military, government agencies, companies that do environmental work, engineering firms, insurance companies, telecommunications and more. Technology has greatly improved GIS so it's also being used in fields like meteorology and anthropology. This type of information is put into maps to identify spatial patterns.</p>
      <h5 class="mainpadding2">What is Spatial Data?</h5>
      <p class="gridtextgrey">Spatial data can be information that is on - or near - Earth's surface: geography, topography, and hydrography. Spatial data also includes information about man-made features and natural features. A related term is geoinformation.</p>
      <h5 class="mainpadding2">How can GIS help businesses?</h5>
      <p class="gridtextgrey">GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems. It is a software that allows you to map out your business. Geographic Information Systems are being used widely by businesses that need to target locations for new stores or identify where their next potential customer is located. You can pinpoint where your clients are, how they are getting to your business, and what they want. GIS is vital for many types of businesses because it provides data on areas that weren't previously accessible by other means.</p>
      <h5 class="mainpadding2">What is Location Intelligence?</h5>
      <p class="gridtextgrey">Location intelligence is the process of analyzing location data to identify patterns. People use it for all sorts of things, like marketing campaigns, urban planning, and disaster response. It can be used to answer questions like “How can we increase foot traffic in this store?”
          Powerful GIS software like MapInfo Professional helps organizations make better and faster decisions where location is a critical factor.
          In summary, GIS is an exciting technology that unlocks the relationship between your business 
          information and the world around us. More and more businesses are utilizing GIS and Spatial Data to make better, faster and more accurate decisions.</p>
